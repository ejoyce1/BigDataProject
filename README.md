Linear regression in spark 
In this repo there is my main jupyter notebook as well as predictions from one of my test sets. 

I had predictions from other test sets but they were too big to fit into this repo. The text file here has about 300k predictions but my other test predictions for other test sets have 1 million each(so they didnt fit).

My writeup is also attached as a PDF.
